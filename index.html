					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<p> I was born in Singapore and grew up in Malaysia. I moved to Australia to study and work, and I am currently a resident there.I speak English and can speak Malay conversationally. I have a background in industrial design and have some
					experience with graphic design and illustration.</br>

				<p>In my free time I like to exercise - specifically power and Olympic lifting or ride my bicycle around the nearby lake. I also enjoy playing video games, cooking, listening to history and philosophy podcasts, and petting my cat Nebby
					(pictured above).</p>

					<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
				</header>

				<p>I have been fascinated with computers and technology as far as I can remember. I especially like the act of creating something new and thinking about possible implications and applications. When I was 10 years old, I remember my dad
					showing me a flight simulator game and that was one of the earliest memories I have of IT. I do not have any professional experience with IT, but I have self-learned some rudimentary Flash, HTML, CSS and Python.
				</p>
				<p>I choose to come to RMIT because I wanted to expand my knowledge in the field and start a career in IT. I think that being able to create programs and applications is a great skill to have - and combined with my background in design would
					give me many more
					possibilities to express creativity. During my studies I hope to learn more about the technical aspects of this field and a framework that I can apply to any further learning into IT. I realize that IT is a field that is constantly evolving
					and changing – I want to learn the skills to be able to evolve and change with it.

					<h2>Personality Profile</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Personally, I think these personality tests are pretty much just modern horoscopes. I disagree with judging people based on these results and even basing employment on a self (or not psychologist)-administered test. Nevertheless, I
					understand that it is highly likely that I will have to take them as part of an interview process, and I will probably be categorized according to them. Agree with them or not I will have to adapt and use them to my benefit.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Myers Briggs test, I got a result of INFP-T. According to my results, an INFP-T(mediator) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These personality types supposedly tend
					to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do. For the learning style test, my results were that I am a visual learner. This means that I learn best that I learn best
					being able to visually conceptualize ideas and information. Lastly the Big 5 personality test results were that on one side of the spectrum I am very introverted and moody, but I am open to new ideas and quite agreeable socially.
				</p>
				<p> I realize that even if I do not hold much sway to these results, my teammates or employers might and thus I would try to work on the opposing personality traits to balance what I have (or what I am perceived to have). Regardless of the
					accuracy certain things about the results do apply to me and if nothing else it helps me be more aware of these traits and work on those that I feel affect me or others negatively. For instance, I realize that being very introverted –
					sometimes I do not properly express my opinions or do not communicate effectively. Being aware of these issues do give me a baseline to work on and help me understand what I could improve.
				</p>
				<p> When forming a team, I would choose people with different personality traits so that there is a wide range of viewpoints and ideas. I think that being able to look at a problem from as many points of view as possible is a valuable
					resource. I would also try to choose people who I think would be more suited to specific roles, for example – people who are more assertive and sociable to be in leadership positions.

					<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
				</header>

				<!--<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>-->

				<p>This position is for a junior software developer to resolve IT issues and create new programs and applications whilst maintaining and improving the current platform. This position is appealing to me because the company is relatively
					new and small, and their mission is to make solar power more accessible and widely used. The environment and making a difference in people’s lives is important to me. The position also seems like something I would constantly be
					challenged with and must adapt to. This position requires 2 years of experience developing scalable web applications, and working knowledge of web, framework, database, and testing technologies.
				</p>
				<p>If I were to apply for this job I would first start developing my own projects to work towards their two-year experience requirement. My projects would be some type of scalable web application. I would also need to further my knowledge
					in all the technologies the position requires. I have some rudimentary knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Python. I would have to learn NodeJS, React, Vue, Mongo DB, Mocha, Chai, Supertest, further my knowledge of GIT, AWS and continuous
					integration and delivery. I would try to learn what I could during my course at RMIT and learn what I do not independently. For the database technologies I would try to develop web apps that integrate them to get more experience with
					them and likewise with the frameworks and testing. I think the best way to learn would be to experiment and apply the technologies required in a practical way. I do not think I would get any extra formal education unless I am really
					struggling.

					<h2>Project Idea</h2>
				</header>

				<h3>Overview</h3>
				</br>
				<p>My project idea is to make an android app to track and improve progression on strength training. It will record data of the user’s workouts, help them plan and create a personalized routine specifically for power or Olympic lifting
					with a focus on progressing on the technical aspects of the lifts and improving strength and explosiveness. It will feature a clean, modern, and neutral interface and will include descriptions of exercises and how to improve on form.
					Although there are existing solutions for tracking certain aspects of training and creating routines, none offer a complete package that has a focus on usability and openness of information and personal data. Unlike other solutions, the
					application will also implement a method to utilize periodization in long term training.
				</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				</br>
				<p>The Australian health department recommends muscle strengthening activities two or more days per week (Health, 2014). Strength training has been corelated with multiple positive health benefits such as improved metabolism (Churilla JR,
					2012;), protection from neural degradation (Alzheimer’s) (Kathryn M.Broadhouse, 2020) and improved mental health (Westcott, 2012). Even though exercise is something that has been gaining traction in popular culture, strength training is
					not as prevalent as cardio and aerobic activities – according to a study, 9 out of 10 Australians do not engage in sufficient strength training (Jason A. Bennie, 2016). This is an issue not limited to Australia either; in the US, a
					study found 60% reporting no muscle strengthening activities (Jason A. Bennie, 2018).
				</p>
				<p>
					Information on how to start strength training tends to be hard to find, most pre-made routines are expensive and or not tailored individual needs. The goal of this app is to help address some of these issues people have with starting
					and staying motivated with strength training and to provide a more accessible way to do so. A major demographic of this application would be the lower income and elderly population.
				</p>

				<h3>Description</h3>
				</br>
				<p>
					The application will be an on the android mobile platform. As previously stated, the goals for this application are to assist the user to start strength training, record all their relevant data and progression, help them stay motivated
					and have a routine tailored to their own needs. The application will have a database of a wide variety of exercises possible for the user to pick from and incorporate into their routine; with detailed instructions on how to do them
					safely and correctly. There also will be instructions of variations and similar exercises based on the availability of equipment and capabilities of the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					The focus of the app would be a calendar system where the user can note down the sets, repetitions, and weight of their chosen exercises of the day. There would be page where the user can save, import, export and load ‘routines’ which
					would be customizable sequences and groups of exercises. As the user records more data from their workouts, the user will be able to visualize the progress made. The routines would be fully customizable and preset popular routines
					available to try if the user is so inclined.
				</p>
				<p>
					A more unique feature of the application would be to allow the user to utilize periodization in their routine. This refers to a technique that breaks long term training into cycles with different goals. These cycles are usually volume,
					strength, and peaking. The application will give you an option to combine routines to create these cycles with helpful tips and explanations if the user needs guidance.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of recording data, there will be a self-contained stopwatch and timer to time rest and work periods, the times would be automatically recorded during an active session. There would be a simple weight plate counter – in strength
					training there are standardized weight plates and the ability to quickly calculate how many and which plates are needed is helpful. There also will be the option to track heartrate, imported from popular fitness wearables such as Garmin
					or Samsung watches.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, the application will provide visual feedback of past workouts and progress with graphs and charts. A tally of total weight moved, time spent, repetitions, sets and various other data collected across all routines and
					workouts will be accessible too. A possible metric that could be included in Version 2 of the application would be the popularity of specific exercises - users of the application can choose to endorse exercises and the relative
					popularity of each exercise is displayed. This feature could possibly help users who have trouble selecting exercises out of the extensive library.
				</p>
				<p>The application will have the capacity to be customized; the user will be able to select interface themes or specific colors. The overarching design language will prioritize accessibility and ease of use for elderly users. All the user
					and recorded data will have the option to be exported or shared to other popular applications like Google Fitness, Strava or as a plain XML file. There will also be an automatic backup feature, syncing all user data to a cloud-based
					file system like the users Drop Box or Google Drive. This will serve the dual purpose of giving the user more control over personal data whilst removing the need for any dedicated database server.
				</p>

				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				</br>
				<p>
					This application will require several tools and technologies to develop. Adobe XD is a wireframing and prototyping tool that will enable the developer to quickly create mockups of the completed product to test the user experience before
					working on much code. Adobe Photoshop is an image editing program that will allow the developer to design the user interface to the required specifications. Android Studio is a popular development environment for developing android
					applications (Maresco, 2021) where the bulk of the application’s code will be written. Java and Kotlin are programming languages supported by the android operating system that the application will be written in. To assist with debugging
					and ensuring the developer would require ADB or the Android Debug Bridge, this will allow the developer to quickly trouble-shoot any issues with the code. LeakCanary is an open-source tool that enables the developer to quickly find
					memory leaks caused by the application. As a database of the exercises and recorded data is required, SQLite, a popular relational database management system is another technology used in this application. Finally, Git and GitHub is a
					free open-source distributed version control system and will be instrumental in providing a way to track and coordinate the project over the course of its development. To manage the Git repository and versions, the developer will
					require a command line interface for Git such as Git Bash. This will allow the developer to control and update the project remotely and collaborate with other developers.
				</p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
				</br>
				<p>
					A host of skills will be required to successfully develop and implement this project. From a design standpoint, the ability to use Adobe XD and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, 2021) effectively will be important. The developer will create
					several wireframes and mockups of the user interface first before writing any code. There are many free online tutorials and training that give a basic understanding of these tools such as Udemy and Coursera. The application will be
					written in Java or Kotlin. As such, developer would need to be adept at the mentioned programming languages – these skills can be acquired from the respective language documentation and tertiary studies in RMIT. For the specifics of
					Android application design, resources such as the MIT app inventor will be helpful in acquiring the skills required (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2021).
					Additionally, an understanding of databases and SQLite will be necessary as the data recorded by the user and the library of exercises will be stored in a database. Training would be required to understand databases extensively and the
					SQLite documentation should be consulted to acquire further knowledge of its specific use. Knowledge of several popular application and service provider APIs will also be required. APIs or Application Programming Interfaces (MuleSoft
					LLC, 2021) will allow the application to communicate and exchange data with other popular services, for example Google Drive to back up the user’s data.
				</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				</br>
				<p>
					The project is successful if the application works reasonably well with no major bugs and with long term consistent use by the users. Short term use would be beneficial but not ideal. A good outcome would be that the application gives
					the user the impetus to start strength training if they have been reluctant or unsure before. The original problem of a low number of adults engaging in muscle strengthening activities could be solved to some degree by an easy to get,
					intuitive and engaging mobile application that keeps the user motivated. This development possibly has an impact of improving the health of a large population of the public especially in the lower income and elderly populations.
